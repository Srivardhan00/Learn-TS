>tsc -init
- creates tsconfig.json file

> tsc
- then <filename>.js is created
- default uses var keyword, function assignments, etc
- change "target" key's value in tsconfig file to required ex: "ES6"
- default combines every ts file to its own js file
- To only compile few files on this command, add a new key under "compilerOptions", with "files":[], add file names in array
- to include exclude use keys "include" with array of required paths, or "exclude" with required paths
- to set path for compiled js files, we use "outDir" in "compilerOptions" and mention folder name for them

- Declaration files end with .d.ts

USING PACKAGES
- some packages come with types on install , ex: axios
// for others , ex:express
- install types by `npm i @types/<package-name>`
